# Django Bylaws Agent (Unofficial)

This was an experiment to build an AI Agent that can help answer common questions about Django's Bylaws.

Please note: It's not official or legal advice.

## Usage

```shell
$ uv run agent.py "How long are director terms?"
Answer: Director terms are for two (2) years.

Reasoning: According to Section 4.4.1 of the Django Software Foundation's Bylaws, directors are elected to two-year terms. This means that once elected, each director
holds office for a period of two years until their successor is elected or until other circumstances such as resignation or removal occur.

Sections:
- Section 4.4.1
